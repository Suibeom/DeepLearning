# DeepLearning
These were coded while working through Geoffry Hinton's deep learning Coursera course. At the time, there were no good deep learning frameworks for Julia and I wanted to learn the language, so I reimplemented the algorithms by hand (like you do, in a good course on algorithms..!)
I think they were written for Julia v0.4, and some aggressive refactoring has been done now that we're at v1.02 so some stuff probably needs to be tweaks to make them runnable on the latest stable Julia version.
Echo State Networks are antique technology now, but I thought they were fun. Same with Restricted Boltzmann Machines...
